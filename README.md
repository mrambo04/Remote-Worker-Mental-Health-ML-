# 📊 Remote Worker Mental Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project investigates how remote-working conditions impact mental health and builds a machine-learning model to predict mental-health outcomes for remote workers.
## 📘 Overview  
This project investigates how remote-working conditions impact mental health and builds a machine-learning model to predict mental-health outcomes for remote workers.

## 🎯 Objective  
To analyse remote vs onsite/hybrid work patterns, identify key features correlated with mental health issues, and build a predictive model that organisations can use for early intervention in remote-work setups.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🧮 Approach  
1. Data ingestion & cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns between work location, workload, support systems and mental-health condition  
3. Feature engineering (e.g., hours worked, virtual meetings, work-life balance)  
4. Model building (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost)  
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC)  
6. Insights & Recommendations  

## 📈 Key Results  
- Best performing model: **[Xgboost]** with good Accuracy  
- Top predictive features: Work-location (remote/hybrid), Number of virtual meetings, Work-life balance rating, Company support for remote work  
- Insights: Remote workers with inadequate support show significantly higher risk of mental-health issues  

## 📂 Dataset  
 (Company internal data)  

## 🌐 Real-world Application  
This model can help HR teams and remote-work strategists to:  
- Proactively identify employees at higher risk of mental-health challenges due to remote work conditions  
- Tailor remote-work policies (virtual-meeting load, company support) to safeguard employee well-being  
- Monitor changes over time in remote-work settings and adapt interventions
